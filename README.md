# IceCascade

This is a fork and modified version of Cascade, originally developed by Jean Braun.

Changes have been made by the [ESD Group of the University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen-kontakte/mineralogie-geodynamik/forschungsbereich/geologie/workgroup/).

Most changes have been done by Willi Kappler and [Paul R. Eizenhöfer](mailto:paul-reinhold.eizenhoefer@uni-tuebingen.de).

A paper has been published describing the recent changes by Paul R. Eizenhöfer.

In order to build the binary you need a Fortran and a C compiler. It has been tested with gfortran and GCC.

To build just type

```
make
```
